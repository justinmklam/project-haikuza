An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

Autumn moonlight
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

Lightning flash
what I thought were faces
are plumes of pampas grass.

A summer river being crossed
how pleasing
with sandals in my hands!

Light of the moon
Moves west, flowers' shadows
Creep eastward.

In the moonlight,
The color and scent of the wisteria
Seems far away.

Trusting the Buddha,
good and bad, I bid farewell
To the departing year.

Everything I touch
with tenderness, alas,
pricks like a bramble.

Over the wintry
forest, winds howl in  rage
with no leaves to blow.

The crow has flown away:
swaying in the evening sun,
a leafless tree.  

In the coolness
of the empty sixth-month sky...
the cuckoo’s cry. 

Whitecaps on the bay:
A broken signboard banging
In the April wind. 

ground squirrel
balancing its tomato
on the garden fence 

As the wind does blow
Across the trees, I see the
Buds blooming in May
 
I walk across sand
And find myself blistering
In the hot, hot heat

Falling to the ground,
I watch a leaf settle down
In a bed of brown.

It’s cold and I wait
For someone to shelter me
And take me from here.

I hear crackling
Crunch, of today’s new found day
And know it won’t last

Falling to the ground,
I watch a leaf settle down
In a bed of brown.

A cricket disturbed
the sleeping child; on the porch
a man smoked and smiled.

I'm turning over
look out and give me room there
you cricket, you.
